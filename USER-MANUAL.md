## Current availability

The repository contains a buildable native Android Camera2 foundation. Representative Android 16 / API 36 emulator evidence verifies preview and one bounded JPEG + MediaStore still-capture path. No physical device is qualified and this is not a supported release.

Authoritative source also includes a bounded engineering video/audio workflow. Source checks, unit tests, lint, and APK assembly pass, but video/audio recording and microphone routing have not yet been runtime-qualified on an audio-capable representative target.

## Current engineering workflow

1. Build the exact repository revision with JDK 17, Gradle 9.6.0, Android SDK 37, and AGP 9.4.0.
2. Install the generated debug APK on a development device or emulator.
3. Launch **GoreeCloud Camera** and grant camera permission.
4. Wait for the engineering status to show `Session: previewing`.
5. Use **Capture photo** to request a JPEG still. On the verified bounded path, the status shows `Photo saved: <filename>` and the image is published under `DCIM/GoreeCloud Camera` through MediaStore.
6. Where the current device reports a compatible bounded video output and microphone hardware, **Record video** becomes available.
7. The first deliberate Record-video action requests microphone permission if it has not been granted. Granting the permission does not auto-start recording.
8. Deliberately choose **Record video** again after permission is granted to request H.264 MP4 video with AAC microphone audio. During an active recording the engineering shell reports that the microphone is active and exposes **Stop and save video**.
9. Leaving the activity closes the active camera/session outputs and cleans up handled in-process pending capture state.

Steps 6–8 describe the implemented engineering control path. They do not constitute a runtime-support claim until separate video/audio qualification evidence exists.

## Permission behavior

- `android.permission.CAMERA` — required for preview and capture.
- `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO` — requested only after the user deliberately chooses video recording with audio.

The current milestone does not request Internet, location, broad storage, all-files, or media-library read permissions.

## Current limitations

The interface remains an engineering shell. Video/audio runtime qualification, microphone-routing evidence, physical-device support, local settings, zoom/focus/exposure UI, production Glaze UI, Private Capture, rich metadata policy, downstream Gallery/Photos handoff, interrupted/process-death recovery, and production signing remain unqualified or unimplemented.

A visible `Photo saved` or `Video saved` result is engineering-state feedback; supported-device claims require the separate qualification process and artifact verification appropriate to the capability.

## Troubleshooting

- If camera permission is denied, use the on-screen camera permission button and Android permission controls.
- If microphone permission is denied, preview and photo capture can remain available; video-with-audio recording remains off.
- If no compatible bounded video output or microphone capability is reported, the app keeps video recording unavailable rather than inventing support.
- If photo/video finalization fails while the process remains alive, the implementation attempts to discard the pending MediaStore row and reports failure.
- A source/build/CI success does not qualify a physical phone or prove video/audio runtime behavior.

The required GoreeCloud-wide representation is `GoreeCloud/User Manuals/User Manual — GoreeCloud Camera.md`; this repository `USER-MANUAL.md` remains the canonical editable source.
